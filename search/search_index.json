Here's how to set up notwells for local development. Fork the notwells repo on GitHub. Clone your fork locally $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/notwells.git Ensure poetry is installed. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv: $ poetry install -E test -E doc -E dev Create a branch for local development: $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Now you can make your changes locally. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox: $ poetry run tox Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub: $ git add . $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\" $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature Submit a pull request through the GitHub website. Pull Request Guidelines \u00b6 Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines: The pull request should include tests. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and describe how to use the feature in the usage.md file. The pull request should work for Python 3.8 and 3.9. Check https://github.com/LondonBiofoundry/notwells/actions and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions. Tips \u00b6 $ poetry run pytest tests/test_notwells.py To run a subset of tests. Deploying \u00b6 New versions are deployed via GitHub Actions : A push to the master branch will trigger a release on TestPyPI . Publishing a new release on GitHub will trigger a release on PyPI .
